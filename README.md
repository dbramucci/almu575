# Almu575

This is a domain specific markup language intended to make it easier
to type algorithms.

The name comes from **Al**gorithm **m**ark**u**p language for CIS **575**.

## Language Design

The language is a designed around the idea of environments and
symbols. An environment does something to the internal text, for
example `\bold { text }` will make the `text` bold. A symbol is
something that is intended to be replaced by a string. For example,
`\assign` will become `тна`.

## Environments

The following environments are available for use. They must be prefaced with a `\` to be used.

* `title`: Renders the text as the document title. Limit 1 per document.
* `author`: Renders the text as the author of the document. Limit 1 per document.
* `date`: If the text block is empty it will produce todays data, otherwise it will render the provided text as the date at the beginning of the document.
* `section`: Generates a label for a section.
* `subsection`: Generates a label for a subsection
* `code`: Leaves the code inside untouched except for all `\`'s must be written as `\\` because `\` is still used for symbols. So `\assign` will still become `тна` even in a `code` block.
* `displaymath`: Renders math using Mathjax (latex-style equations) as a standalone equation.
* `math`:  Renders math using Mathjax (latex-style equations) inline.
